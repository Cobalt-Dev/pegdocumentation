# Key Changes

### Payments & Tokens

1. Control boxes are not GSM-enabled, and cannot be communicated with directly. A token system is used to activate the control box for days of light.

2. A token is a 12-digit code that the user receives via SMS, and inputs it into their control box to activate it for light.

3. Once a payment comes in, the token will only be sent to the primary phone number on record for that account.

4. Each token is unique to the control box that it was generated for, and must be used in the specific order that they were generated in.

5. Tokens do not expire. The customer is free to input that token at any time to receive days of light, even if that means they will show up as delinquent in the Atlas system.

6. If a customer enters the wrong token 5 times in a row, the control box will be locked for 1 hour.

7. Once a token has been issued, it cannot be recalled.

8. Credit expires 24 hours after it is entered, instead of at midnight.
