# Key Changes

### Customer Care

1. Call Center Agent will have to manually search for the customer's profile on Atlas using the incoming phone number. Profile will not be launched automatically.
2. Payments that a user has made while they are blocked will not automatically go through after they have been unblocked. They will have to be re-processed individually.
3. In order to reverse a wrong payment, a ticket must be raised with Atlas to increase the buyout price of the recipient of the erroneous payment, and then refund the payment.
4. Call initiator, inbound/outbound, and status are not captured in the call log.

5. Call scripts will not be available automatically on screen
